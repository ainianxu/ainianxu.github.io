<ul>
<li><strong>There is a simple but enlightening sentence</strong> - “Nowadays more and more people keep learning new skills to adapt to a fast-changing world”,which can be naturally associated with the necessity of acquiring new skills.<strong>Provided that we intend to achieve long-term success in the ever-changing world,it is advisable for us to master as many new skills as possible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>As a college student, I am convicend that</strong> we should equip ourselves with three major skills: foreign language skills,interpersonal communication skills and innovation skills.To begin with, foreign language skill <strong>is like a stepping stone which enables us to</strong> travel or work freely in world without commuication barriers.</li>
<li>Besides,<strong>living in an are of globalization</strong>,people are closely connected with each other in study ,work and life.<strong>Without interpersonal commuication skill,our life and career would be a mess.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supposing that youngsters intend to acquire and enjoy wonderful and rewarding living,it is advisable for them to have a good balance between job responsibilities and pesonal interests</strong>.How to achieve that? There are several measures.</li>
<li>To begin with,college students are supposed to improve their working efficiency.**Without a doubt,efficiency is the stepping stone which enhances their speed of working,ensures more useful results,and enables them to go further on the way of both work and life.**Living in an era of intense competition, <strong>without efficiency,they are prone to confine themselves to poor abilities and narrow-mindedness.</strong></li>
<li>In addition,it is rational for  youngsters to limit the number of hobbies,since spending too much time on interests may distract their major tasks.<strong>A typical example is that</strong> once trapped by a host of hobbies including playing chess,and painting,my friend Dave had no time to finish working.</li>
<li><strong>Last but not the least</strong>,<strong>as a yongster myself,I am deeply convinced that</strong> we ought to give our <strong>priority</strong> to job responsibilities,the rest of time can cultivate personal interests.</li>

You should start your essay with a brief description of the chart and comment on China’s achievements in poverty alleviation. You should write at least150 words but no more than 200 words.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is a simple but enlightening chart where</strong> China^,^s rural population in poverty decreased rapidly from more than 75 million people in 2012 to zero in 2020.**Without any doubt,**China has made great contributions and achievements in poverty alleviation.</li>
<li>On the one hand,<strong>without</strong> China^,^s various policies in realizing the goal of common prosperity,<strong>it would be impossible for people to live a wealthy life</strong>;<strong>our economy is prone to confine itself to low efficiency and poor development</strong>. To be specific,Chinese poverty alleviation policies <strong>are like engines which can enrich</strong> people^,^s lives in rural areas,enhance people^,^s living standards,<strong>ensure</strong> more useful results in protecting human rights,and <strong>enable our society to go further</strong> on the way of economic prosperity, On the other hand,to get rid of poverty,<strong>a growing number of</strong> impoverished people <strong>have realized</strong> the importance of diligence intelligence and unity.</li>
<li>Thus,as a chinese, <strong>I deeply that provided that</strong> our society <strong>intends to</strong> acquire and enjoy common wealth and long-time prosperity,<strong>it is advisable for everyone to</strong> work together to alleviate poverty.<strong>Only in this way can</strong> the poor gain life-long benifits from the economic development</li>

<li><p><strong>有一个简单但有启发性的说法&#x2F;句子&#x2F;图画&#x2F;图表</strong>-{}，<strong>如果</strong>{年轻人}<strong>打算</strong>{获得并享受美好而有意义的生活}<strong>，建议他们</strong>{在工作责任和个人兴趣之间取得良好的平衡}</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>首先</strong>，{大学生应该提高他们的工作效率}。<strong>没有疑问</strong>，{效率}<strong>是提高</strong>人工作速度的<strong>垫脚石，</strong> <strong>保证了更多丰硕的结果，</strong> <strong>使</strong>人在工作和生活的道路上都走得更远</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>此外</strong>， <strong>对于</strong>{我们作为年轻人}来说，{对生活、工作和学习负责}<strong>是非常必要的， 生活在一个激烈竞争的时代 ** <strong>没有</strong>{效率}，</strong>他们很容易把自己局限于能力差和心胸狭窄。**</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>最后但并非最不重要的一点，我，作为一名大学生，我相信</strong> 我们把工作职责放在首位<strong>是合理的</strong>，其余的时间可以培养个人兴趣。} &#x2F; <strong>一个典型的例子是</strong>{我的朋友Dave曾经被下棋、绘画等一大堆爱好所困，以至于没有时间完成工作}。&#x2F; 名人生活的<strong>深刻意义</strong> <strong>使我们相信</strong> {终身学习的习惯}<strong>是驱动我们学习和未来事业的引擎</strong>。</p>

Of course, using a smartphone is a difficult problem, but provided that most people intend to enjoy wonderful and convenient living, it is advisable for them to transfer money via smartphone. </li>
